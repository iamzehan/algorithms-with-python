A brief look at algorithms with python

# Thinking of going back to the basics?

The struggle is real when it comes to the basics of coding. Sometimes, we forget the basics while working on the more advanced stuff.
Don't worry, I've got you, and you've got this too. Let's go through those hard-to-grasp, abstract problems that make your head scratch.
Let's buckle up and say:

# Why look here?
Well they don't break down codes for you like this, do they? 

# code
```python:
